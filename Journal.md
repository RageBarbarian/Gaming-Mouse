# DAY 1 12/16/25: 3D DESIGN + MICROCONTROLLER LIBRARY DOWNLOAD:
MEMBERS: VARUN, ANIRV; AGNI WAS NOT AVAILABLE
TIME: 6:30-7:30pm
WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED: We have been able to develop the portotype design of our advanced gaming mouse. We added the functions decided on including the arrows keys and space bar along with the normal functions of a mouse. We designed a few parts in OnShape like the base of our mouse with an asthetic design and with the keys needed. We have also been able to go on KiCAD and download one of the necessary libraries needed for our PCB: the microcontroller. We have decided that our micrcontroller shall be the Seeed XIAO ESP32C3 chip due to its small structure and also being fast + reliable. It will fit into our 3D mouse base nicely but we might decide on something else otherwise. Our mouse PCB will be mainly inspired by the Bambu lab mouse kit.

# DAY 2 12/23/25: CREATING THE 3D DESIGN(CASE) AS WELL AS LISTING THE ELECTRONIC/CIRCUIT PARTS WE NEED TO PUT INTO KiCAD
MEMBERS: VARUN, ANIRV, AGNI
TIME: 4:30-6:30
WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED: We have decided that most of the circuit components we are using in our mouse is going to be from the official Bambu Lab mouse kit. AGNI found these parts in the Bambu kit and listed them so we can later download them into KiCAD for our final PCB. ANIRV and VARUN worked on the journal as well as the 3D case that maps around the circuits. We are going to design the case through Onshape CAD.

# DAY 3 12/29/25: FINISH THE 3D CASE
MEMBERS: VARUN, ANIRV, AGNI
TIME: 4:00-7:00
WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED: We finished the 3D mouse and drilled to make holes in the mouse. We then added some push buttons and used super glue to secure it in place. VARUN informed AGNI and ANIRV about all the parts of the mouse and how to use them.

# DAY 4 12/31/25: 
MEMBERS: VARUN, ANIRV, AGNI
TIME: 4:00-6:00
WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED: Changed plans and now decided to to make a mouse and keyboard. We made a new draft in OneShape with all the new componets added.
