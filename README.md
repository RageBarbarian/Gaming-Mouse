# Gaming-Mouse
This is a feature-packed gaming mouse including 5 custom keys set to Arrow Keys and Space Bar as default. Also, this mouse, called **SDSNS8530**, retains the primary functions of a regular mouse. This is ideal for hardcore gamers who want a smooth experience. We made this mouse so we can free the left hand to perform nessesary tasks.
